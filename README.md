# License Agreement
This template is subject to the conditions of the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/templates-examples/AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf">MuleSoft License Agreement</a>. Review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. You can use this template for free with the Mule Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio. 
# Use Case
<!-- Use Case (start) -->
This Anypoint template serves as a foundation for setting an online sync of accounts from Oracle Siebel Business Objects to Salesforce.
Every time there is a new account or a change in an already existing one, we will poll for changes from Oracle Siebel Business Objects source instance and it will be responsible for updating the account in Salesforce target instance.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this template leverages the Mule batch module.

The batch job is divided in *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

The integration is triggered by a scheduler defined in the flow. The template then makes a query for the newest Oracle Siebel Business Objects updates/creations matching a filtering criteria and executing the batch job.
During the *Process* stage, each Siebel Account is filtered depending on existing matching Account in Salesforce.
The last step of the *Process* stage groups the users and create/update them in Salesforce.
Finally during the *On Complete* stage the template logs statistics data into the console.

<!-- Default Considerations (end) -->

<!-- Considerations (start) -->
To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made for the template to run smoothly. **Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

## Salesforce Considerations

Here's what you need to know about Salesforce to get this template to work:

- Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=checking_field_accessibility_for_a_particular_field.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field</a>.
- Can I modify the Field Access Settings? How? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=modifying_field_access_settings.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings</a>.


### As a Data Destination

There are no considerations with using Salesforce as a data destination.
## Oracle Siebel Considerations

Here's what you need to know to get this template to work with Oracle Siebel.

This template uses date time or timestamp fields from Oracle Siebel to do comparisons and take further actions. While the template handles the time zone by sending all such fields in a neutral time zone, it cannot discover the time zone in which the Siebel instance is on. It's up to you to provide this information. See [Oracle's Setting Time Zone Preferences](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B40099_02/books/Fundamentals/Fund_settingoptions3.html).

### As a Data Source

In order to make the Siebel connector work smoothly you have to provide the correct version of the Siebel jars that works with your Siebel installation. [See more](https://docs.mulesoft.com/connectors/siebel-connector#prerequisites).

<!-- Application Configuration (end) -->

# API Calls
<!-- API Calls (start) -->
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***X + X / ${page.size}***

Being ***X*** the number of Accounts to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***${page.size}*** is because, by default, Accounts are gathered in groups of ${page.size} for each Upsert API Call in the aggregation step. Also consider that these calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 11 api calls will be made (10 + 1).

# Customize It!
This brief guide provides a high level understanding of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs. As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template. More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

* config.xml
* businessLogic.xml
* endpoints.xml
* errorHandling.xml<!-- Customize it (start) -->

<!-- Customize it (end) -->

## config.xml
<!-- Default Config XML (start) -->
This file provides the configuration for connectors and configuration properties. Only change this file to make core changes to the connector processing logic. Otherwise, all parameters that can be modified should instead be in a properties file, which is the recommended place to make changes.<!-- Default Config XML (end) -->

<!-- Config XML (start) -->

<!-- Config XML (end) -->

## businessLogic.xml
<!-- Default Business Logic XML (start) -->
This file holds the functional aspect of the template, directed by one flow responsible of conducting the business logic.

Functional aspect of the template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow that will poll for SalesForce creations/updates.
Several message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this template:

1. The template queries all the existing accounts from Oracle Siebel Business Objects created/modified after watermark.
2. During the *Process* stage, each Siebel Account is filtered depending on existing matching Account in Salesforce.
3. The last step of the *Process* stage groups the users, create/update them in Salesforce.
4. Finally during the *On Complete* stage the template logs statistics data into the console.<!-- Default Business Logic XML (end) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (start) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (end) -->

## endpoints.xml
<!-- Default Endpoints XML (start) -->
This file is conformed by a Flow containing the Scheduler that will periodically query Siebel for updated/created Accounts that meet the defined criteria in the query. And then executing the batch job process with the query results.<!-- Default Endpoints XML (end) -->

<!-- Endpoints XML (start) -->

<!-- Endpoints XML (end) -->

## errorHandling.xml
<!-- Default Error Handling XML (start) -->
This file handles how your integration reacts depending on the different exceptions. This file provides error handling that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.<!-- Default Error Handling XML (end) -->
